It was the time of the rise of specialized educational centers, where people could get deep knowledge in many different fields of science and became either scientists or engineers.</p> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <p>Briefly, the main difference between scientists and engineers is that scientists <strong>discover</strong>, but engineers <strong>invent</strong>. That is Engineers, using discoveries of scientists, invent <em>systems</em>, <em>devices</em>, <em>processes</em>, which they <em>design</em>, <em>develop</em>, <em>implement</em>, <em>build</em>, <em>manage</em>, <em>maintain</em>, and <em>improve</em> as different stages of the Engineering process. Engineering is a practical application of scientific knowledge, integrated with business and management. In other words, engineers act as a bridge between science and society by doing inventions for the real world and people.</p> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <p>In the modern time of the Information Age, the role of an engineer has been extended by non-technical skills, as a result of the globalization and spreading of trade relationships across the globe. These are skills such as intellectual (communication, foreign languages, critical thinking), management (time management, self-organization, planning), and standards awareness (tech certifications, best practices).</p> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <a class="reference external image-reference" href=https://vorakl.com/files/engineering/engineers.png><img alt=Engineers class=img src=https://vorakl.com/files/engineering/engineers.png style="width: 100%;"></a> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <a class="reference external image-reference" href=https://vorakl.com/files/engineering/engineering.png><img alt=Engineering class=img src=https://vorakl.com/files/engineering/engineering.png style="width: 100%;"></a> </div> </div> <div class=article style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; font-style: italic"> Found a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">bug</span> or <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">typo</span>?
