The unique science if everyone could agree that it is Science. But, it's also hard to argue that it is not Art. Math is absolutely certain, except the cases when it is not (&quot;<a class="reference external" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-certain-39>as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality</a>&quot;). Still having no one general definition, math doesn't even bother to have one opinion on such the fundamental building block as <a class="reference external" href=https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/evolution-of-numbers.html>Numbers</a>. Nevertheless, math is an important part of almost every field of science, engineering, and human life.</p> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <p>Here is the most common and well-accepted number classification tree:</p> <a class="reference external image-reference" href=https://vorakl.com/files/numbers/numbers.png><img alt="Number classification" class=img src=https://vorakl.com/files/numbers/numbers.png style="width: 100%;"></a> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <p>It also shouldn't be a surprise to find slight distinctions in the meaning of the same essences in <em>Math</em> and <em>Computer Science</em> (CS):</p> <ul class=simple> <li><strong>Natural numbers</strong>. In Math, they are meant to be <em>Positive Integers</em> (1, 2, 3, ...), but in CS they are <em>non-negative Integers</em> which include Zero (0, 1, 2, 3 ...)</li> <li><strong>Mantissa</strong>. In Math, it is a <em>fractional part</em> of the logarithm. In CS, it is <em>significant digits</em> of a floating-point number (thus, quite often are used other definitions in this case, like <a class="reference external" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand>significand</a> and coefficient)</li> </ul> <div class=line-block> <div class=line><br></div> </div> <p>There is a quite related topic in terms of the values which a variable can take on. In mathematics, a variable may be two different types: <a class="reference external" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable>continuous and discrete</a>:</p> <ul class=simple> <li>A variable is <strong>continuous</strong> when it can take on infinitely many, uncountable values. There is always another value in between two others in a non-empty range, no matter how close they are.</li> <li>A variable is <strong>discrete</strong> when there is always a positive minimum distance between two values in a non-empty range. The set of numbers is finite or countably infinite (e.g. Natural numbers)</li> </ul> <p>The understanding of the discreteness is crucial in Computer Science as all real-world computers internally work only with discrete data (which makes it challenging to represent Irrational numbers). All existing computability theories (e.g. <a class="reference external" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis>Turing thesis, Church thesis</a>) are defined on discrete values, and the domain is the set of Natural numbers.</p> <!-- Links --> </div> </div> <div class=article style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em; font-style: italic"> Found a <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">bug</span> or <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">typo</span>?
