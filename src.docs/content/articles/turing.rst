Alan Turing is one of the pioneers of the computability theory and logic
formalization. He came up with the hypothesis of which algorithms can be
implemented and computed by machines (`Turing's thesis`_), created an abstract
model of such machine (`Turing machine`_), and described absolutely vital abilities
of any system for being able to realize any logic that can be computed
(`Turing completeness`_).

|

Turing's thesis is only one of the existing formal systems in the computability
theory. There are also Î»-calculus, Markov algorithms, but they all were implemented
on the Turing Machine that is used at this time as a general computational model
to classify which real-world systems (mostly programming languages) are able
to compute mathematical functions or implement algorithms.

|

All existing computability theories are defined on discrete values, and
the domain is the set of `Natural numbers`_.

I prepared several mindmaps to summarize basic ideas and statements:
