The main, if not the only, purpose of a computer is to compute information.
It doesn't always have to be a computation of mathematical formulas. In general,
it is a transformation of one piece of information into another. Computers only
work with information that can be represented as discrete data. The input and
output of a computer engine are always `natural numbers`_ or text (a sequence
of symbols from a dictionary that correspond to certain natural numbers).

As long as data is unstructured, it's hard to make some sense of it. But once
data is given a structured form, it becomes meaningful and suitable for further
transformation.

Type
----

The simplest form of data organization is **Type**. In general, a *data type*
defines a set of values with certain properties. It usually defines a size
in bytes. A **primitive data type** is *an ordered set of bytes*. When a variable
of a primitive data type has only one value (holds only one piece of information),
it's called a **scalar** and a type - **scalar data type**. Well-known examples
are *integer, float, pointer, and char*. A *collection of primitive (scalar)
data types* is called an **aggregate data type**, and it allows multiple values
to be stored. This can be a homogeneous collection, where all elements are of
the same type, such as an array, a string, or a file. Or it can be heterogeneous,
where elements are of different types, such as a structure or a class. The main
property is an ordered set of bytes. The internal organization is simple,
straightforward, and all actions (e.g. reading or modifying) are performed
directly on the data, according to a hardware architecture that defines
the byte order in memory (little-/big-endian).

Data Structure
--------------

The next level of data abstraction is called **Data Structure**. It brings more
complexity, but also more flexibility to make the right choice between access
speed, ability to grow, modification speed, etc. Internally, it's represented
by a collection of the scalar or aggregate data types. The main focus is *on
the details of the internal organization and a set of rules to control that
organization*. There are two types of data structures that result from
a difference in the memory allocation of the underlying elements:

* **Array Data Structures** (static), based on physically contiguous elements
  in memory, with no gaps between them;
* **Linked Data Structures** (dynamic), based on elements, dynamically allocated
  in memory and linked in a linear structure using pointers (usually, one or two)

Well-known examples are *linked list, hash (dictionary), set, list*. These data
structures are defined only by their **physical** organization in memory and
a set of rules for data modifications that are performed directly. All internal
implementation details are open. The actions performed on the data structures
(add, remove, update, etc.) and the ways in which they are used can vary.

Abstract Data Type (ADT)
------------------------

A higher level of data abstraction is represented by an **Abstract Data Type**
(ADT), which shifts the focus from "how to store data" to "how to work with
data". An ADT represents a **logical** organization, defined mainly by a
list of predefined operations (functions) for manipulating data and controlling
its consistency. Internally, data can be stored in any *data structure* or
combination thereof. However, these internals are hidden and should not be
directly accessible. All interactions with data are done through an interface
(operations exposed to users). Most of ADTs share a common set of *primitive
operations*, such as

* **create** - a constructor of a new instance
* **destroy** - a destructor of an existing instance
* **add**, **get** - the set-get functions for adding and removing elements of an instance
* **is_empty**, **size** - useful functions for managing existing data in an instance

The most common examples of ADTs are *stack* and *queue*. Both of these ADTs
can be implemented using either array or linked data structures, and both have
specific rules for adding and removing elements. All of these specifics are
abstracted as functions, which in turn, perform appropriate actions on internal
data. Dividing an ADT into operations and data structures creates an abstraction
barrier that allows you to maintain a solid interface with the flexibility
to change internals without side effects on the code using that ADT.

Object
------

A more comprehensive way of abstracting data is represented by **Objects**.
An object can be thought of as a container for a piece of data that has certain
properties. Similar to the ADT, this data is not directly accessible (known as
*encapsulation* or *isolation*), but instead each object has a set of tightly
bound methods that can be applied to operate on its data to produce an expected
behavior for that object (known as *polymorphism*). All such methods are really
just functions collected under a *class*. However, they become methods when
called to operate on a particular object. Methods can also be inherited from
another class, which is called a *superclass*. Unlike an ADT, an object doesn't
represent a particular type of data, but rather a set of *attributes*, and it
behaves as it should when its methods are invoked. Attributes are nothing more
than variables of any type (including ADTs). Formally speaking, classes act
as specifications of all of the object's attributes and the methods that can
be invoked to deal with those attributes.

|

The **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) paradigm uses objects as the central
elements of a program design. At program runtime, each object exists as
an instance of a class. The class, in turn, plays a dual role: it defines
the behavior (through a set of methods) of all objects instantiated from it,
and it declares a prototype of data that will carry some state within the object
once it's instantiated. As long as the state is isolated (incapsulated) in
the objects, access to that state is organized by communication between
the objects via message passing. It's usually implemented by calling a method
of an object, which is equivalent to "passing" a message to that object.

|

This behavior is completely different from the `Structured Programming Paradigm`_,
which instead of maintaining a collection of interacting objects
with an an embedded state, relies on dividing of a project's code into
a sequence of mostly independent tasks (functions) that operate with
an externally (to them) stored *state*.
