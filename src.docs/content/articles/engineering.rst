With the coming of the Industrial Age (approx. 1760-1950), an agricultural
society transitioned to an economy, based primarily on massive industrial
production. It was the time of the rise of specialized educational centers,
where people could get deep knowledge in many different fields of science and
became either scientists or engineers.

Briefly, the main difference between scientists and engineers is that
scientists **discover**, but engineers **invent**. That is Engineers, using 
discoveries of scientists, invent *systems*, *devices*, *processes*, which they
*design*, *develop*, *implement*, *build*, *manage*, *maintain*, and *improve*
as different stages of the Engineering process. Engineering is a practical
application of scientific knowledge, integrated with business and management.
In other words, engineers act as a bridge between science and society by doing
inventions for the real world and people.

In the modern time of the Information Age, the role of an engineer has been
extended by non-technical skills, as a result of the globalization and spreading
of trade relationships across the globe. These are skills such as intellectual
(communication, foreign languages, critical thinking), management
(time management, self-organization, planning), and standards awareness
(tech certifications, best practices).
