:summary: A brief overview of my career and how I got to where I am today

Hi! I'm glad you're here, and I hope you find something interesting and useful in this blog. It serves an educational purpose and is a kind of notebook where I document what I've learned in computer systems and software engineering. So you are likely to find articles about computer systems architecture, embedded systems, operating systems, clouds, observability, performance tuning and troubleshooting, programming, automation, debugging, and so on. If you find a mistake or a typo, have an idea to discuss, or just want to tell me something, send me a message via `any of the available channels`_ and I'll be happy to chat with you!

I currently reside with my family in Seattle, WA. However, prior to moving to the United States, I also lived in Ukraine, Poland, and Germany. I've been working in the field of computer systems engineering for two decades. Although, my formal education is in *Telecommunications Engineering* which I received at the `National Technical University of Ukraine`_ and graduated with a Master's degree in 2004. In my professional life, I have worked for companies in many different industries, including retail, e-commerce, Internet service providers, and multinational high-tech companies. Throughout my career, I've been designing, building and maintaining computer networks and distributed systems with a focus on automation and site reliability. I have experience with various types of infrastructure, from on-premises to cloud computing.

My personal journey with computers began around 1992 when I started taking after-school programming classes at Sphere_ and had some fun with Basic on a `Soviet PDP-11-compatible`_ hardware. I continued writing some simple games in Basic at home when my parents bought me a `ZX Spectrum`_, which was the iconic computer of the time. Later, when I had access to a PC with an Intel Pentium processor, I opened up a whole world of `Turbo Pascal 7.0`_ and desperately tried to understand object-oriented concepts with the `Turbo Vision 2.0`_ library. Last 2 years of high school I was taking extra programming classes and got a certificate of *Assistant Programmer* in 1998. In the first years of university I suddenly discovered computer networks. During the day I was administering a FidoNet_ node on the dial-up line at home, but at night I was surfing the Internet. I was so interested in networking and Unix that in my last year at university I applied for the 2-year course of *Computer Networks and Systems Administration* at `computer academy Step`_, which I finished in 2005 with a diploma with honors.
