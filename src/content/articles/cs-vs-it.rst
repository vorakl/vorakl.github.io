If you ever thought about getting a computer-related (graduated) education, you
probably came across a variety of similar disciplines, more or less connected
to each other, but grouped under two major fields of study: Computer Science (CS)
and `Information Technology`_ (IT). The latest one sometimes comes in a broader
meaning - `Information Communications Technology`_ (ICT), and Computer Science,
in turn, is highly linked to Electrical Engineering.
But what exactly makes them all different?

Briefly, Computer Science creates computer software technologies,  Electrical
Engineering creates hardware to run this software in an efficient way, while
Information Technology uses them later to create Information Systems for
storing, processing and transmitting data.

CS is a study of **using computation** and computer systems for
solving real-world problems. Dealing mostly with software, the study includes
the theory of computation and computer architecture, design, development, and
application of software systems. The most common problems are organized in
groups in particular areas, such as Distributed Systems, Artificial
Intelligence, Data Science, Programming Languages and Compilers, Algorithms
and Data Structures, etc. Summarizing, CS mainly focuses on
finding answers to the following questions (by `John DeNero`_, cs61a):

- which real-world problems can be solved using computation
- how to solve these problems
- how to solve them efficiently

|

The fact that CS is all about software, makes it tightly coupled to
*Electrical Engineering* that deals with hardware and focuses on designing
computer systems and electronic devices for running software in the most
efficient way.

|

Unlike CS, IT is a study of **using computers** to design, build, and operate
*Information Systems* which are used for storing and processing information (data).
ICT extends by applying telecommunications for receiving and transmitting data.
It is crucial to notice, that IT apply *existing technologies* (e.g. hardware,
operating systems, systems software, middleware applications, databases,
networks) for creating Information Systems. Hence, IT professionals are users
of technologies and utilize existing solutions (hardware and software) to create
larger systems for solving specific business problems.
